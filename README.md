# Numerical methods for Option Pricing

## 1°) Motivations

I wrote this code to carry out a short thesis on numerical methods for options pricing.
More precisely, my goal was to compare deterministic methods such as Finite Difference Methods with 
probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo simulations for Options pricing.

## 2°) The code at a galnce

#### Finite_Difference_Methods.py
- contains Python classes for Explicit, Implicit and Crank Nicolson methods 

#### Options_Pricing.py
- contains a general Option class with Monte Carlo methodds functions, closed Form solutions..

#### analysis_tools_kit.py
- functions for data tables output
